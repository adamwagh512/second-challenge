                <p>Hello, My name is Adam Wagh and thank you for checking out my portfolio page. I am brand new to coding and am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp which is being offered through the University of Texas at Austin. This portfolio was made as part of our 2nd coding challenge. It took several hours to complete and I learned quite a bit by making it, but as you can tell I still have much to learn. I spent the better part of a decade working as a paramedic, and am now looking to take on brand new challenges. Hopefully the teamwork, problem solving and critical thinking skills that I developed during my last career can help me succeed in my new one! My resume and contact information are listed below so please feel free to reach out to me. </p>
