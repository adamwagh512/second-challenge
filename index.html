I am brand new to coding and am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp which is being offered through the University of Texas at Austin. I currently live in New Braunfels, Texas. New Braunfels is a beautiful town located between Austin and San Antonio. This portfolio was made as part of our 2nd coding challenge. It took several hours to complete and I learned quite a bit by making it, but as you can tell I still have much to learn. I spent the better part of a decade working as a paramedic, and although I loved the work I was doing, I am now looking to take on brand new challenges. Hopefully the teamwork, problem solving and critical thinking skills that I developed during my last career can help me succeed in my new one! My resume and contact information are listed below so please feel free to reach out to me. </p>
